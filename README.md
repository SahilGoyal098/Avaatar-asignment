<h1 align="center" id="title">Place an object‚Äôs image in a text-conditioned scene</h1>

<p id="description">This project focuses on using generative AI to create realistic product photographs by seamlessly integrating an object image (with a white background) into a text-generated scene. The goal is to place the object naturally into various contexts preserving its details while ensuring that the scene aligns with aspects like lighting spatial positioning and realism.</p>

<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Realistic Background Generation: Utilizes advanced generative AI (Stable Diffusion Inpainting) to create visually appealing and contextually relevant backgrounds based on text prompts enhancing the overall scene realism.
*   Efficient Object Masking: Implements refined mask creation to accurately separate the product from its background preserving details and ensuring the object remains unaltered in the final output.
*   Dynamic Resizing with Controlled Placement: Supports dynamic resizing of the object while maintaining its center positioning allowing for smooth transitions and natural-looking placements in various scenes.
*   Seamless Integration into Videos: Generates a sequence of frames that create smooth transitions and coherent storytelling in video output enhancing user engagement.
